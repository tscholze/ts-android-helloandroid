=======================

This is my very first Android playground. Do not except fancy stuff.

The app contains at the moment (v 0.0.1) a simpel rss reader of the codebuddies.de's feed combined with a very clean and green'ish Material Design theme. My goal was also to use external libraries to avoid boilerplate code aka a own rss parser implementation.

Ideas
====

Due to the fact, that this is my Android palyground I wanna add some new features to the projects. There is no shedule and now 'I have to' - it's just like Debian's slogan: "Ready when it's ready". 

If you wanna join me and explore as a beginner the new Android universe (min SDK: 21) - fork me or contact me on Twitter or find me on Google Plus. I'm the guy with the Panda avatar. ;)
